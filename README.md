# Customer Segmentation for Marketing

## Project Summary
This project focuses on segmenting customers based on both **demographic** and **behavioral** data to improve targeted marketing strategies.

### Key Objectives:
- **Understand customer behavior**: Analyze customer data to uncover patterns and preferences.
- **Optimize marketing strategies**: Create personalized marketing plans for each customer segment.
- **Increase customer retention**: Develop loyalty programs for high-value segments.
- **Boost revenue**: Leverage insights to upsell and cross-sell relevant products.

### Methodology:
- Data preprocessing, including scaling and handling missing values.
- Applied **K-Means clustering** to segment customers.
- Used **Elbow Method** and **Silhouette Score** to determine the optimal number of clusters.
- Analyzed and interpreted the clusters to create actionable insights.

### Results:
The segmentation results revealed clear customer groups, allowing for more focused and effective marketing efforts, improving both customer engagement and overall business performance.
